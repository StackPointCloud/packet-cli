	Use:   "assign",
	Short: "Assign command",

	Example:
	
	packet assign ip -d [device-id] -a [ip-address]

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// assignCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// assignCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
