## Packet Command Line Interface

[Packet](https://www.packet.net/) provides an API-driven bare metal platform that combines the automation experience of the cloud with the benefits of physical, bare metal servers.

The Packet CLI wraps the [Packet Go SDK](https://github.com/packethost/packngo) allowing interaction with Packet platform from a command-line interface.

## Requirements

* Packet authentication token.
* Packet CLI [binaries](https://github.com/packethost/packet-cli/releases).

## Supported Platforms

The [Packet CLI binaries](https://github.com/packethost/packet-cli/releases) are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X for various architectures including ARM on Linux.

## Installation

Download the appropriate Packet CLI binaries for your platform to the desired location and rename it to `packet`. If the directory is not already in your `PATH` environment variable, then it will need to be added.

### Configuring your Path

<details>
  <summary>Configure your path in Linux</summary>

## Linux

If you plan to run the Packet CLI in a shell on Linux and placed the binary in /home/YOUR-USER-NAME/packet-cli/, then type the following into your terminal:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/packet-cli
```

You can view the current value of $PATH by running:

```
echo $PATH
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure your path in Mac OS/X</summary>

### Mac OS X

If you plan to run the Packet CLI in a shell on a Mac, download the `darwin` binary and placed the it in /Users/YOUR-USER-NAME/packet-cli/, then type the following into your terminal.

```
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/$USER/packet-cli
```

You can view the current value of $PATH by running:

```
echo $PATH
```

When running the downloaded binary on a Mac, you may be prompted with the following message:

> "packet" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified

The binary can be trusted by enabling "App Store and identified developers" in "System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General".  Any blocked apps will appear in the bottom of this window, where they can be authorized.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure your path in Windows</summary>

### Windows

If you plan to run the Packet CLI in PowerShell on Windows and placed the binary in c:\packet-cli, then type the following into PowerShell:

```
$env:Path += ";c:\packet-cli"
```

The path can be viewed by running:


```
echo $env:Path
```
</details>

### Shell Completion

Once installed, shell completion can be enabled (in Bash) with `source <(packet completion bash)` (or for some versions of Bash, `eval "$(packet completion bash)").

Check `packet completion -h` for instructions to use in other shells.

## Authentication

The Packet authentication token can be stored in the `$PACKET_TOKEN` environment variable or in JSON or YAML configuration files. The configuration file path can be overridden with the `--config` flag.

Environment variable:

```bash
export PACKET_TOKEN=[PACKET_TOKEN]
```

YAML configuration file - `$HOME/.packet-cli.yaml`:

```yaml
---
token: PACKET_TOKEN

```

JSON configuration file - `$HOME/.packet-cli.json`:

```json
{
  "token": "PACKET_TOKEN"
}
```

After installing Packet CLI, verify the installation by executing `packet` or `packet.exe`. You should see the default output:


```bash
$ packet
